# Collapse Instead of Close

> Use a collapse button instead of a close button for dismissible content, allowing users to hide rather than destroy.

## Why It Matters

The distinction between "collapsing" and "closing" changes user perception. Closing implies permanent destruction; collapsing implies temporary hiding with the ability to retrieve. When users dismiss a "What's New" popup or notification panel, they are hiding it, not destroying it. Respecting this mental model reduces anxiety about losing access to information.

## How to Apply

- Replace close (X) buttons with collapse/minimize icons for content that can be retrieved.
- Maintain the popup's state in the interface (e.g., a badge or indicator showing hidden content exists).
- Provide easy access to reopen the hidden content.
- Use language and icons that suggest "minimize" or "hide" rather than "close" or "dismiss".
- Reserve true close/dismiss for ephemeral content like toasts or one-time alerts.

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Are "What's New" panels, notification centers, and info popups collapsible rather than closeable?
- [ ] Can users easily find and reopen collapsed content?
- [ ] Does the UI indicate that hidden content is available (badge, indicator)?
- [ ] Is the iconography consistent (minimize icon vs. X icon)?
