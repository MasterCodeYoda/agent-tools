## Why It Matters

Generic call-to-action text like "Follow us on X" adds instructional overhead and feels impersonal. Displaying the actual handle (e.g., "@detaildotdesign") feels native to the platform, reduces cognitive friction, and creates a more direct connection. It is simultaneously more informative (users see the handle) and more concise.

## How to Apply

- Replace "Follow us on Twitter/X" with `@yourhandle`.
- Display the social platform icon alongside the handle for context.
- Apply across web, mobile, and print contexts.
- Ensure the handle is a clickable link to the profile page.
- This works for all social platforms: GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.

## Code Example

```html
<!-- Instead of this -->
<a href="https://x.com/detaildotdesign">Follow us on X</a>

<!-- Do this -->
<a href="https://x.com/detaildotdesign">
  <svg class="icon-x">...</svg> @detaildotdesign
</a>
```

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Do social links display the actual handle rather than generic "Follow us" text?
- [ ] Is the platform icon displayed alongside the handle for context?
- [ ] Is the handle a direct link to the profile page?
