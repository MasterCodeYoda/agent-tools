# Respect Brand Name

> Use correct capitalization for brand names: GitHub, not Github. macOS, not MacOS.

## Why It Matters

Brand names have specific, intentional capitalization that reflects company identity. Using incorrect capitalization (Github instead of GitHub, MacOS instead of macOS, Iphone instead of iPhone) appears careless and diminishes brand recognition. Getting these details right signals professionalism and attention to quality.

## How to Apply

- Maintain a brand name style guide for your team with correct capitalizations.
- Common examples: GitHub, macOS, iOS, iPad, iPhone, YouTube, JavaScript, TypeScript, LinkedIn, WordPress.
- Use find-and-replace or linting rules to catch common misspellings.
- Include brand guidelines in documentation standards and code review checklists.
- Pay special attention in user-facing copy, documentation, and marketing materials.

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Are brand names (GitHub, macOS, iOS, etc.) capitalized correctly throughout the app?
- [ ] Is there a style guide documenting correct brand name usage?
- [ ] Do code review checklists include brand name verification for user-facing text?
