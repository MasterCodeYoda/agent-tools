## Why It Matters

AI features can feel cold and utilitarian without personality. Character customization transforms an AI assistant from a generic tool into an engaging experience users connect with emotionally. Using varied action verbs, visual animation, and customizable personas makes the AI feel like a thoughtful collaborator rather than a text generator.

## How to Apply

- Create customizable AI character options (like Notion's AI character appearance).
- Use descriptive, varied action verbs to communicate what the AI is doing (Claude Code's approach: "thinking", "analyzing", "writing" instead of just "loading").
- Apply thoughtful animation and visual feedback to AI interactions.
- Let users personalize their AI assistant's appearance or tone where appropriate.
- Add personality to AI responses through careful copywriting.

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Do AI features communicate their current state with varied, descriptive language?
- [ ] Is there visual feedback (animation, progress indicators) during AI processing?
- [ ] Does the AI assistant have a consistent personality and voice?
- [ ] Can users customize the AI experience where appropriate?
