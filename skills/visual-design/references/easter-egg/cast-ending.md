# Cast Ending

> A landing page reaches 100% perfection through final polish details -- the last 1% that separates good from great.

## Why It Matters

Moving from 99% to 100% requires attention to every remaining surface: cursor interactions, state transitions, edge cases, loading states, and micro-moments users encounter but rarely consciously notice. These final touches reveal craft and care, transforming a polished product into a premium one. It is the design equivalent of a film's closing credits -- a deliberate statement that every detail was considered.

## How to Apply

- Audit every interaction surface for unfinished edges: hover states, empty states, error states, loading states.
- Add personality to moments users encounter infrequently (404 pages, completion screens, onboarding endings).
- Use the "cast ending" as inspiration: treat the final polish pass as a creative act, not a checklist.
- Focus on cursor interactions, micro-animations, and transitional moments.
- Ask: "If a designer zoomed into this pixel, would they see intentionality?"

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Have all edge-case states (empty, error, loading, success) been designed intentionally?
- [ ] Do cursor interactions, hover states, and transitions feel complete?
- [ ] Has the interface been audited at the micro-interaction level for unfinished details?
- [ ] Do infrequently-seen pages (404, settings, about) receive the same design attention?
