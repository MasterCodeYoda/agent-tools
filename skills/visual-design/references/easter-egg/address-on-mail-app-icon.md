## Why It Matters

Apple embeds meaningful references even in places users rarely notice -- the tiny text on the Mail icon envelope. This level of craft reinforces brand identity and rewards users who look closely. It demonstrates that attention to detail is not just a design principle but a cultural value that permeates every level of the product, down to icon pixels.

## How to Apply

- Include hidden text or details in icon designs that reference meaningful values (company address, founding date, team in-jokes).
- Layer information subtly within visual elements so careful inspection reveals additional context.
- Ensure hidden details are accurate and meaningful, not random.
- Use this technique in app icons, loading screens, about pages, and other inspectable surfaces.

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Do product icons and visual assets contain meaningful hidden details?
- [ ] Are hidden details accurate and intentionally placed?
- [ ] Do inspectable surfaces (about pages, icon details) reflect company culture?
