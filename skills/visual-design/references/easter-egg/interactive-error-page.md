## Why It Matters

Few users encounter error pages, but those who do are already frustrated. An interactive error page transforms a negative experience into a moment of delight, reinforcing brand personality and keeping users engaged rather than bouncing. "Few people get there, but it's nice to reduce their sadness when they do."

## How to Apply

- Design error pages with interactive elements: animations, clickable objects, mini-games, or playful micro-interactions.
- Include clear navigation back to functional areas of the site.
- Add personality through tone and visual design that reflects your brand.
- Ensure accessibility is not compromised by interactivity (provide text alternatives, keyboard navigation).
- Make the page memorable enough that users share it, turning an error into marketing.

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Do error pages provide interactive or engaging elements beyond a plain error message?
- [ ] Is there clear navigation back to the main site?
- [ ] Does the error page reflect the brand's personality and design language?
- [ ] Is the error page accessible (keyboard navigable, screen reader compatible)?
