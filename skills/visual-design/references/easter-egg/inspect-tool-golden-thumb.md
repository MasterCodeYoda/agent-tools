# Inspect Tool Golden Thumb

> A hidden easter egg in Vercel's inspect tool that has been present since launch -- rewarding curious developers.

## Why It Matters

Easter eggs in developer tools create community moments. When someone discovers a hidden feature and shares it, it generates organic word-of-mouth and reinforces the brand's identity as a team that cares about craft. The fact that this has been "live on Vercel since day 1" demonstrates long-term commitment to delight.

## How to Apply

- Hide subtle interactions within tools or interfaces that activate under specific conditions.
- Make easter eggs discoverable through curiosity (unusual click patterns, keyboard shortcuts, hover states).
- Ensure easter eggs are non-disruptive: they should delight, not confuse.
- Keep them stable -- an easter egg that breaks is worse than no easter egg.
- Consider developer tools and inspect modes as prime locations for hidden features.

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Are there hidden easter eggs in the product that reward developer curiosity?
- [ ] Do easter eggs remain stable and non-disruptive across updates?
- [ ] Is the team's craft and personality expressed in unexpected places?
