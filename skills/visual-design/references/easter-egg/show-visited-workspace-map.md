## Why It Matters

Easter eggs reward curiosity and create memorable moments that strengthen emotional connection to a product. Transforming workspace visit data into an interactive map visualization turns mundane navigation history into something users want to explore and share. These hidden features create positive surprise and demonstrate that the team cares about delight, not just function.

## How to Apply

- Track workspace or location visits in navigation history.
- Create a hidden trigger (menu item, keyboard shortcut, or special gesture) to reveal the visualization.
- Render an interactive map with visited locations as pins or markers.
- Make the feature discoverable but not obvious -- the delight comes from finding it.
- Keep the implementation lightweight: it should not impact performance for users who never find it.

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Are there hidden features that reward exploration and curiosity?
- [ ] Do easter eggs feel intentional and polished, not like bugs?
- [ ] Are easter eggs lightweight enough to not impact performance?
- [ ] Is the product's personality expressed in unexpected moments?
